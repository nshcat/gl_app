- Important: GUI STATE IS NOT PART OF THE GAME LOGIC
	=> It is local state in the view!
		=> e.g. AI does not have UI state, but local_player has
		=> This decouples UI from GameLogic/State
=> GameState only concerns the state of the game data
=> GUI state is purely located in the view and is used to issue commands and display information
=> settings are completely local (keymaps, layout, colors)
=> example: If player opens main menu, game input is disabled BY NOT SENDING COMMANDS
	=> the remote game logic does not need to know about this
