- Refactor different parts of the game into separate namespaces (gfx, input, rng ...)
- Global defined types for glyphs, colors etc
- Random class that supports all kinds of operations. One, global, auto-seeded (e.g. time, random_device) instance (instance()) for game rng,
  but random should also be constructible for local RNG (map gen, using fixed seed to replicate mapgen)
  - IMPORTANT: Refactor main.src! Currently, all values are part of main() thats bad, because nothing can be put into functions!
  		=> Either put it into global state, or wrap as much as possible with classes (render_manager contains glfw.. etc, nk_manager, debug_ui ..)
