- On different systems, user data is saved in different locations
- Additionally, the game should be able to run both in portable mode (data and user data in same folder as binary),
  aswell as in install-mode (data in e.g. /usr/share, user data somewhere in $HOME)
- This means that a class is needed that is able to find the correct folder/file to use
	- This could be done on a "first come first serve" basis:
		- Establish a "search order", e.g. first search the application folder, then the /usr/share etc.
		- This of course is system dependant.
- Usage example: Normally, during development, the configuration file is stored in the application folder, and thus
  is found first.
  
- Class is called "path manager" and is a global system
  
- Class could receive a string identifiying the game (e.h. "roguelike"), because this is needed to check if paths
  are there
  
- `path_manager` exposes methods to retrieve different kinds of paths:
	- configuration file path
	- data prefix
	- user data prefix
